# sk-go-duet-config

This is a SK-Go Duet configuration set for an SK-Go running sensorless homing.

I have made the following changes to my machine:

1) 0.9 degree steppers for x/y/z
2) Indictive sensor z probe
3) T8-4 lead screws from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZC666KV/
4) Mosquito hotend (tuning will differ dramatically)
5) Cooling fan for the stepper drivers
6) Upgraded to RepRapFirmware-3.x
